- Edit is mandatory for every incremental change, especially small edits. DO NOT use Write or Bash `sed`.
- Read the target file with Read before every Edit. DO NOT call Edit from memory, stale context, or a guessed `old_string`.
- Take `old_string` and `new_string` from the Read output view.
- Drop the line-number prefix and tab; match only file content.
- `old_string` must be unique unless `replace_all` is set.
- If `old_string` is ambiguous, add surrounding context. Use `replace_all` only when every occurrence should change — for example, renaming a symbol throughout the file.
- Multiple Edit calls may run in one response only when they do not target the same file.
- DO NOT issue consecutive Edit calls on the same file without reading it again in between. A previous Edit can invalidate a later Edit's `old_string`, causing `old_string not found`."""

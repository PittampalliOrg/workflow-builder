# Dynamic Script Workflows (SSOT)

User-authored JS orchestration scripts — a port of Claude Code's internal Workflow tool —
executed durably on Dapr. Scripts use `agent()`, `parallel()` (barrier), `pipeline()`
(per-item staged, no barrier), `phase()`/`log()`, `workflow()` (one-level nesting), and the
globals `args` + `budget {total, spent(), remaining()}`. Shipped wfb #446–#449 + stacks
#3613/#3614/#3619; verified end-to-end on dev 2026-07-07.

> **Authoring** (how to write a correct script here): `docs/dynamic-script-authoring-guide.md`
> is the platform-dialect SSOT — the primitives PLUS the deltas from the upstream Claude Code
> spec that change what a script observes (`opts.model` is a platform model KEY not a tier alias;

## Architecture — the re-execution pump

The JS script cannot run inside the Python generator orchestrator, so
`dynamic_script_workflow_v1` (workflow-orchestrator) loops:

1. `aggregate_script_usage` — budget spend (Σ `agent.llm_usage`, goal-loop net-of-cache formula)
2. `evaluate_script` — the activity loads the journal from the BFF and POSTs the whole
   request to the stateless **script-evaluator** Node service, which re-executes the ENTIRE
   script in a `vm.SourceTextModule` sandbox (clock/RNG banned), resolves journaled calls
   from `completedResults`, and returns `{status: need|done|script_error, tasks, phases,
   newLogs}` with only NEW callIds
3. dispatch each new task through the standard `durable/run` machinery
   (`spawn_session_for_workflow` → `call_child_workflow("session_workflow", app_id=…)`)
   under `DYNAMIC_SCRIPT_MAX_CONCURRENCY`
4. `when_any([cancel, control, *outstanding])` → drain ALL completed children →
   `record_script_call_result` (journal row + schema validation + structured-retry
   decision) → loop

Dapr replay = crash resume. **callId** (frozen by
`services/shared/contracts/script-evaluator-evaluate.contract.json`):
`sha256(prompt + NUL + canonicalJSON({schema,model,effort,isolation,agentType,label}))[:40] + "_" + occurrence`.

## Where things live

- Engine: `services/workflow-orchestrator/workflows/{dynamic_script_workflow,script_agent_dispatch}.py`
  - activities `evaluate_script`, `script_call_journal`, `aggregate_script_usage`,
  `append_script_logs`; route `POST /api/v2/script-workflows`
- Evaluator: `services/script-evaluator/` (`/evaluate`, `/validate`, `/healthz`; port 3300,
  Service 8080→3300; `--experimental-vm-modules`; zero secret deps)
- BFF: `engineType='dynamic-script'` (spec `{engine, script, meta, defaults?}`);
  `src/lib/server/workflows/dynamic-script-validation.ts`; start branch in `start-run.ts`;
  journal table `workflow_script_calls` (drizzle 0097) + internal routes
  `…/executions/[id]/script-calls[…]` + `…/llm-usage`; run UI `script-run-panel.svelte`
- MCP (workflow-mcp-server, `services/workflow-mcp-server/src/script-tools.ts`): four tools —
  `run_workflow_script` (saved `workflowName` or inline `script` via
  `POST /api/internal/agent/workflows/execute-script`; ownership comes from the authenticated
  workspace, while `X-Wfb-Session-Id` is optional lineage), `validate_workflow_script`
  (author-time syntactic check via
  `POST /api/internal/agent/workflows/validate-script` → `validateWithEvaluator` → evaluator
  `/validate`; returns `{ok, meta, estimatedAgentCalls}` or `{ok:false, error}`),
  `save_workflow_script` (creates or updates a workspace-scoped saved script), and
  `get_workflow_script_spec` (returns the embedded platform-dialect guide, kept in sync with
  `docs/dynamic-script-authoring-guide.md`). Recursion guard: the BFF signs `scriptDepth: 1`
  into the session capability for script-spawned sessions; the MCP server ignores caller-controlled
  depth headers and suppresses all four tools when the verified depth is positive.
- **Agent-native `Workflow` tool** (dapr-agent-py, `src/tools/workflow_script/`): the Claude Code
  Workflow-tool mirror — any dapr-agent-py agent (interactive/goal/SW-node) can author + run a
  dynamic-script workflow and digest its returnValue as the tool result, in one durable turn.
  Approach-B shape (like native CallAgent): the agent loop yields the local
  `run_workflow_script_bridge` child workflow = idempotent start activity (POST the internal
  execute-script/execute route with a caller-supplied `executionId`; the BFF short-circuits
  `reused` on activity retry) + durable poll loop (`create_timer` + read-only status activity).
  Blocks up to `timeoutMinutes` (default 30, max 120); on timeout the run continues server-side
  and the agent re-attaches with `{executionId}`. Validation rejections (HTTP 4xx) come back as
  the tool result so the model fixes the script in-loop. Depth-1 guard: script-spawned sessions
  (`__durable-script__` instance ids) are refused — scripts compose via `workflow()`. Kill with
  `AGENT_WORKFLOW_TOOL=0`. The tool description embeds the platform dialect guide (kept in sync
  with the MCP server's copy).

## Operations

- **Execute**: UI confirm dialog, `POST /api/workflows/[id]/execute {input, budgetTotal?}`,
  or the MCP tool. Instance id `dsw-<meta.name>-exec-<executionId>`.
- **Resume-after-edit**: `POST /api/workflows/executions/[id]/resume {}` — fresh execution
  of the CURRENT script; `done` journal rows import; unchanged callIds resolve with ZERO new
  sessions; only edited calls dispatch. (Verified: full-cache resume = 0 sessions; one-line
  edit = exactly 1 new session.)
- **Skip a call**: `POST …/executions/[id]/script-calls/[callId]/skip` → raises
  `script.call.control` → journal `skipped`, the script sees `null`, siblings continue.
  Skipping an already-resolved call is a benign no-op.
- **Stop**: normal Lifecycle Controller (`POST …/stop {mode}`) — no special handling; child
  instance ids match the `__durable-script__<callId[:16]>__run__<N>` wedge-finalize shape.
- **Cancel event**: `workflow.cancel` external event → pump returns cancelled + persists.

## Spec-parity fixes (2026-07, contract 1.1.0)

Five Workflow-tool alignment gaps were closed (evaluator 1.1.0 + orchestrator + BFF + dapr-agent-py):

- **args is verbatim any-JSON** (object/array/scalar/null) end-to-end, with KEY-ABSENCE meaning
  "not provided" → the script's `args` global is `undefined`. Layers: app.py `model_fields_set`,
  pump `has_args`, evaluate activity conditional key, sandbox `"args" in req`. Same for
  `workflow(name, args)` child args.
- **workflow() THROWS on child failure** (unknown ref / child script_error / failed run): the
  journal writes status `error` + errorCode `workflow_child_error` with the reason in
  `result.message` (checked BEFORE the null short-circuit), the dispatch returns a
  `{dispatchError}` marker for unresolvable refs, and the sandbox throws the message into the
  script. User-skip still resolves null. agent() failure semantics unchanged (null).
- **Nested workflow() children share the parent budget**: dispatch propagates `budgetTotal`; since
  usage aggregates by the shared executionId, the child's `budget.spent()` is tree-wide.
  Concurrency/lifetime caps remain per-level.
- **opts.effort is honored on dapr-agent-py**: stamped `agentConfig.reasoningEffort` →
  `resolve_llm_metadata` → `effectiveAgentConfig.llm.reasoningEffort` → call_llm stamps
  `self.llm._reasoning_effort` (set/restored alongside `_llm_component` at BOTH seams) → zai/
  deepseek/openai adapters take it as an override to their env default ({low,medium,high}→high,
  {xhigh,max}→max on GLM/DeepSeek; low/medium/high on OpenAI). Kimi K3 preserves
  `low`/`high`/`max`; unset or unsupported agent-level values use the deployed `max`
  default. Anthropic ignores this field.
- **meta.phases[].model is honored**: `_build_agent_config` resolves
  `opts.model → meta.phases[task.phase].model → defaults.model` (last gated to dapr-agent-py).

## Structured output - schema-enforced (2026-07)

Schema'd `agent(..., {schema})` calls get provider or runtime-enforced structured output on top
of the prompt contract, keyed off the existing `opts.schema` (no callId/contract change):

- **Hybrid routing** (`script_agent_dispatch._build_agent_config`): a schema'd call with no explicit
  model routes to `DYNAMIC_SCRIPT_STRUCTURED_MODEL` (default `kimi/kimi-k3`); per-call
  `opts.model` / per-phase model still wins; gated by
  `DYNAMIC_SCRIPT_NATIVE_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT` (default on), dapr-agent-py only.
- **Threading:** dispatch stamps `agentConfig.responseJsonSchema` → `effective_agent_config.resolve_llm_metadata`
  carries it into `llm.responseJsonSchema` → `main.py call_llm` stamps `self.llm._response_json_schema`
  at BOTH seams (set/restore alongside `_llm_component`/`_reasoning_effort`) → adapters enforce it.
- **Adapters:** object-shaped Kimi K3 schemas use the synthetic `StructuredOutput` tool so
  browser/coding/MCP tools remain usable before finalization; Kimi Pydantic calls and non-object
  schemas retain native strict `json_schema`. `openai_adapter` sets
  `text.format={type:json_schema, strict:true}`. Explicit GLM, Anthropic, and DeepSeek routes use
  the same tool-finalization mechanism where supported.
- **The journal validation + corrective-retry stays the universal authority/fallback** — native
  enforcement is request-side only, so the `agent()`-returns-object-or-null contract is unchanged.
  Effect: schema'd Kimi calls compose tool use with validated finalization, while OpenAI uses
  strict provider-side enforcement before journal validation.
- Default prerequisite: `KIMI_API_KEY` (in `dapr-agent-py-secrets`) is injected into per-session
  sandbox pods. Explicit OpenAI routes still require `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Rejected: the
  Dapr Conversation API (we bypass that alpha building block by design).

## Gotchas (each cost real debugging time — do not regress)

- **`agentConfig.modelSpec` is the model key dapr-agent-py actually reads**
  (`effective_agent_config.resolve_llm_metadata`; `agents/markdown.ts` maps frontmatter
  `model` → `modelSpec`). The dispatch stamps BOTH `modelSpec` + `model`. Stamping only
  `model` silently falls back to the Kimi K3 default.
- **Default model**: BFF env `DYNAMIC_SCRIPT_DEFAULT_MODEL` (default `kimi/kimi-k3`) → sent as
  `defaults.model`, applied ONLY when the resolved runtime is `dapr-agent-py`; per-call
  `agent(..., {model})` always wins.
- **Terminal persistence is explicit**: a workflow that RETURNS an error dict is Dapr
  `COMPLETED`, and the read-model maps COMPLETED→success blindly. All four terminal paths
  (done / script_error / no-dispatchable-work / cancelled) call `persist_results_to_db`.
- **Budget vs ingestion race**: `agent.llm_usage` ingests asynchronously; budget-bounded
  runs park on `create_timer(DYNAMIC_SCRIPT_USAGE_SETTLE_SECONDS, default 3)` after each
  resolving drain so the next aggregate sees settled usage.
- **In-flight overshoot is BY DESIGN** (Claude Code parity): budget exhaustion stops NEW
  dispatches and makes unresolved `agent()` calls throw `BudgetExhaustedError` inside the
  script; already-running children complete and their tokens count.
- **Evaluator determinism**: `Date.now()`/`Math.random()`/zero-arg `new Date()`/timers/
  `import`/`fetch`/`process` throw in the sandbox — required for replay + resume. The
  sandbox is NOT a security boundary (scripts are workflow-spec trust domain);
  `isolated-vm` is a planned hardening.
- **`journal GET` returns `{scriptCalls: [...]}`** (not `calls`) — the orchestrator client
  and run panel both read that key.
- Dev-rollout verification: check POD-level image+env, not Deployment spec — two
  verification rounds were invalidated by stale-pod generations.
- **Mid-run orchestrator restart can wedge a pump with cross-app children in flight**
  (live-observed 2026-07: an orchestrator roll landed while an audit-fanout run had
  agents outstanding; the children completed on their per-session task hubs but the
  completion events never reached the replayed parent — custom status froze at a stale
  `dispatched`/`outstanding` snapshot; same task-hub-boundary root cause as the stop
  wedge). Detection: journal rows all terminal / sessions all `terminated` while the
  execution stays `running` and custom status stops moving. Remediation (verified):
  **stop (`{mode:'terminate'}`) + resume** — resume-after-edit imports the `done`
  journal rows and re-dispatches ONLY the lost calls; per-call **skip** also wakes the
  pump when the outstanding callId is known. Avoid rolling the orchestrator while
  long agent fan-outs are mid-flight on dev.
- **A session host pod that EXITS mid-run is auto-rescued by the liveness reconciler**
  (live-observed 2026-07-07: SIGTERM → uvicorn graceful exit 0 → pod phase `Succeeded`;
  per-session pods are `restartPolicy: Never` and the Sandbox controller does not
  recreate a terminal pod, so the durable session sat `running` with an intact journal
  and no host). The reconciler's `rescue_stranded_host` action detects pod-EXITED +
  Sandbox-CR-present + session-live, deletes the exited pod (the controller recreates
  it, `spec.replicas=1`), and the durabletask worker resumes the workflow via REPLAY —
  same instance, completed activities from history, no re-execution. Attempts are
  capped per session (`SESSION_RECONCILER_MAX_RESCUES`, default 3; each attempt leaves
  a `session.host_rescued` event) and then degrade to an audit-only warn. Note the
  reconciler runs DRY-RUN by default (`SESSION_RECONCILER_DRY_RUN`); manual trigger:
  `POST /api/internal/sessions/reconcile {"dryRun":false}` with `INTERNAL_API_TOKEN`.
  Manual fallback remains `kubectl delete pod <agent-host-…>` on the Completed pod.
